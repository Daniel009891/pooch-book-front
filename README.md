# Unfinished Project 

Apologies for submitting this project unfinished! I have had issues with code anywhere and gitpod for which I had an extension of 3 days. However as my work schedule has changed recently ive not been able to devote as much time as I need to finish this.

Please note this is not a reflection on my mentor as I only had the initial planning meeting with her and was unable to find time to book in any more sessions.

##  Credits 

Much of the code in this was taken from the moments walkthrough as I was using this as a base for my project. I've unfortunately not had time to implement any custom code at this point. Comments will be added to code to state which is custom and which is borrowed on completion.
